# CALT: Computer ALgebra with Transformer

CALT (Computer ALgebra with Transformer) is a simple Python library for learning arithmetic and symbolic computation with Transformer models.
It offers a basic Transformer model and training, and non-experts of deep learning (e.g., mathematicians) can focus on constructing datasets to train and evaluate the model. Particularly, users only need to implement an instance generator for their own task.


## Installation
CALT can be installed via `pip`. 
```bash
pip install calt-x
```

We highly recommend the users to use [CALT codebase](https://github.com/HiroshiKERA/calt-codebase) - a comprehensive template repository to build up your own projects using CALT. The quickstart guide can be found in [CALT codebase documentation](https://hiroshikera.github.io/calt-codebase/).
